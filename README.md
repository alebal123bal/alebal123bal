# Hi, I'm Alessandro

I'm an engineer working across **FPGA design**, **embedded computer vision**, and **machine learning acceleration**.  
I build end‑to‑end systems that connect sensors, hardware pipelines, and software tooling.

My work spans:
- FPGA-based computer vision (camera → DDR → HDMI/USB pipelines)
- Embedded ML (YOLO, quantized inference, on‑device CV)
- Real-time robotics tooling and simulation
- High-performance Python systems (optimization, backtesting)
- Hardware architecture (TL-Verilog, RISC-V educational cores)

## Featured Projects

### ▸ Gowin_FPGA_CV  
**Full real‑time camera pipeline on Tang Primer 20K**  
OV5640 → DDR3 → Triple Buffering → HDMI + USB 2.0.  
Designed with clean Verilog, timing-closure focus, and Python tools.

### ▸ Drone_UAV_YOLO
YOLO‑based detector for UAV tracking and autonomous robotics tasks.  
Includes training pipeline, dataset preparation, and optimization.

### ▸ Drone_Missions_PySimVerse *(private)*  
Mission‑planning algorithms for UAV navigation inside PySimVerse.  
Focused on autonomous behavior, path planning, and simulation realism.  
Leverage Bayesian Mapping for search and rescue missions.

### ▸ BayesOpt_smart  
Lightweight Bayesian Optimization module built for speed and clarity.

### ▸ BackTesting_smart *(private)*  
Jupyter + Python framework for algorithmic trading backtesting.  
Modular, fast, and analytics-ready.

### ▸ ViolaJones_CUSTOM  
From‑scratch implementation of the classical Viola–Jones detector.  
Includes Haar features, integral images, and multi-stage cascade.  
Trained with personal, optimized AdaBoost implementation.

### ▸ AdaBoost_smart
Optimized AdaBoost that leverages a mathematical trick.  
Very fast.

### ▸ Disease_AdaBoost
Medical application of the optimized AdaBoost indigenous implementation.  
Competitive accuracy, with fast training time and features engineering.

### ▸ RISCV_CPU_TL_verilog  
Fork + exploration of TL-Verilog RISC‑V CPU microarchitecture.  
Experimenting with Makerchip and TL-Verilog abstractions.
